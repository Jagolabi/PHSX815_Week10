# PHSX815_Week10

This repository contains the Python program:

* Central_limit_theorem.py 

which can be run from the Terminal line by typing:

`<> python Central_limit_theorem.py `

This requires a working Python distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python packages numpy and Matplotlib also installed.
